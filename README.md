# maximal-biclique-enumeration

## Usage Instructions:

Run the JAR file with the adjacency matrix filepath and the type of algorithm(standard/improved) as arguments:

`java -jar MBEA.jar path_to/filename.txt  _algorithm type_`

### To test:

Go to the main directory and execute :

`java -jar MBEA.jar matrix.txt improved`

## TODO:
- [x] ~~Implement the improved version of MBEA algorithm~~
- [x] ~~Run benchmarks for the algorithms~~
